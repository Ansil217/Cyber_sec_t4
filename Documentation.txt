Step 1 : Open firewall configuration tool
> cmd and run as administrator
>netsh advfirewall commands



Step 2 : List current firewall rules
> cmd- netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | more

>while typing this command,it shows all exixsting rules in pages so we can scroll down for all the rules 
>Useful for baseline before changes
( Screenshot:- netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | more )



Step 3: Add a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)
>cmd- netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block telnet 23" dir=in action=block protocol=TCP localport=23

>dir=in -> inbound traffic 
>action=block -> deny packets
>localport=23 -> filter telnet port
(Screenshot:-Add a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet))



Step 4: Test the rule locally
>cmd- Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 23

> If it's succeded : False -> rule is blocking 
( Screenshot:- Test the rule locally )



Step 5: Remove the exixsting test block rule

>cmd- netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block telnet 23" protocol=TCP localport=23

>It's restore orginal firewall state.
( Screenshot:- Remove the test block rule )



Summarize how the firewall filters traffics

A firewall firstly examines network traffic and ccompare it with its rules. If traffic matches with allw rule, it passes .if it matches a block/deny rule, it's dropped . rules can filter by direction ( inbound /Outbound),(TCP-Transmission Control Protocol/UDP- User Datagram Protocol),port no:,Ip addresses or application.
